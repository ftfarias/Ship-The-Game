SHIP THE GAME

Ship the Game is a join adventure from me and my friend Mitchell (xelamitchell@gmail.com), a fun way to study Design Patterns and DDD programing.
Our goal here is not making a visual stuning game (since neither me nor Mitchell know much about visual design), but study game design and create an application with good programing principles using layers, tests units, real OO, etc

This project was created Netbeans 6.8, and the only lib I'm using is Mockito for tests. The graphics are Swing based.

So far we did:

- The main application (ship.main.ShipApp)
- the bootstrap game class (ship.application.ShipGame)
- Helper classes: Positon, Time, Swing Utils, etc
- the some domain classes:
  -> Ship
  -> Sensor
  -> Power Grid
  -> Power Generator
  -> Move Behavior
  -> Battery
- The UI uses Swing classes and is 2D. I'm trying to focus in a *TRUE* MVC implementation. Of course I'll love to see someone creating a 3D version.
- We are alse plaining to create web services to the game, so it can be played anywhere for many people.
- I created test units (JUnit 4) for the most important classes. I gave up to test all since I'm doing a lot of changes in the project and I don't have time.
- Mitchell is reviewing the code and plaining JMokey integration in the future 

Many domain classes can be extended for more realistic implementations and complex behaviors, using the Strategy Design Pattern. I'm trying to keep the dependences at mininum level.

For the future I'm planning
- weapons and defence systems... FIGHT !!!
- Stelar bases and science outposts
- Some A.I. ships and NPCs
- Asteroids and minning


Please send us any critics, sugestions, ideas, etc. We promise to read and answer asap.
