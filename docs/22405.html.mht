--------------( 3.A When to redesign )-------------------------------------=
---
               ----------------------
With a wealth of techs and weaponry available, the timing for redesign is
quite important. Several options are available, but in general terms, I
recommend redesigning in the following situations:
- New warp drive: Speed is crucial. The faster your ships travel down those
jump lanes, the better your ability to keep the initiative or to react to AI
actions. Further, newer drives take up less space per speed units (this also
applies to system drives, BTW).
- New hull type: what's the use of getting that shiny Leviathan hull if you
don't use it? Superior hull space packs more firepower - use it to your
advantage. I don't necessarily redesign other hulls at that point, though.
- New weaponry: I don't prioritize that part myself. There are a few weapon
techs which almost beg for a full redesign, though, mainly Lightning fields.

Normally, I obsolete old types within 3 turns of a full redesign. Your mile=
age
may vary, though.

Finally, I scrap obsolete reserves as soon as a sizeable reserve of a super=
ior
design is available, which means between 10 and 20 turns of introducing the
new designs.

In relationship with Antaran expeditions, note that launching one will pull
the required amount of ships from your reserves, apparently at random
(excluding transports, colony and outpost). To have better control on what
gets sent out, scrap what you don't need or put it into active taskforces.

On the matter of transports, you'll have noticed that MOO3 has a tendency to
overdo transport building. This is a recognized bug adressed in the upcommi=
ng
patch. In the meantime, make sure you obsolete any transports as soon as you
have suitable reserves.

--------------( 3.B Specialized vs. Combined Arms )------------------------=
---
               -----------------------------------
When building cruiser and bigger hulls, you tend to get enough space to
seriously consider whether you want a "pure" design per ship type or rather
"mixed" weaponry.

Obviously, a "pure" design will pack more damage for the weapon type of
your choice. However, this comes at the cost of versability both in offense
and defense. We'll comment briefly on the pros and cons of each weapon group
a bit later on, but my personal preference goes to "mixed" designs. Whatever
your choice, though, keep in mind that combined arms brings a huge advantage
in being able to confront any situations. If you go for "pure" ship designs,
try at least to mix your ship types when assembling a new TF, even in the=
 main
body.

--------------( 3.C Point Defense )----------------------------------------=
---
               -------------------
Currently, before the code patch gets released, PD is broken. You can't cou=
nt
on PD weaponry to protect your fleet against incoming missiles, which can=
 lead
to severe losses.

However, there is a workaround: it appears that as long as your ships have=
 any
missiles left, the PD weapons will do their job. Hence make sure to equip=
 all
your ships with one single rack of Nuclear warheads (PD mount does fine).=
 Some
people recommend always putting 20 of them. This is not necessary in all
situations, though, as you can waste valuable space doing so. Your PD weapo=
ns
will fire as long as the rack isn't empty - so if you're quite ahead in the
tech race, 8-12 missiles will do nicely. This is related to the duration of
your battles: if most fights end within 3 minutes, chances are you won't be
able to deplete even 8 missiles.

Zhaneel also mentions that the PD bug can be completely offset by issuing
a patrol command (without the missile racks). I haven't verified this mysel=
f,
also note that for my taste, it limits my actions too much.

In terms of equipment, my preference goes to a combination of PD-mounted
phaser beams coupled with a second series of light-mount phaser beams. While
damage is equal, the light mount exchanges range for rate of fire. In pract=
ice
though, I find it an advantage to be able to fire a few shots at incoming
missiles from farther away, diminishing the amount of work the PDs have to
perform to shoot down what's left.

After analyzing the weapon tables, I would recommed replacing phasers with
disruptor cannons once you have all improvements researched for it. See
the analysis in the DF weapon tables for a rundown.

For fighter protection, the most efficient PD weapon by far are lightning
fields. If they aren't on your tech tree, your scientific spies and your
diplomats should work overtime to get it - it's just too invaluable to miss.

Quicksilver posted a first (unnumbered) data patch. One of the huge changes=
 in
there affects missiles and the PD bug. While missile damage has been cut in
half, the rate of fire has been vastly increased. Which means that you'll=20
shoot your missile complement out pretty quick - and so does your opponent.
In terms of PD workaround, be aware that your PD racks will empty much fast=
er
now than before, so if you stick to PD racks, favor 20 missiles over 8-12 :)


--------------( 3.D Comparing Weapon Types )-------------------------------=
---
               ----------------------------
As you will have noticed, MOO3 offers three weapon types: direct fire,
fighters and missiles. Here's a rapid rundown of the pros and cons of each
type:

Direct fire
Pros:
- unlimited firepower
- vast choice of mounts
- Good damage
- Lots of modifications
Cons:
- Maximal range / damage requires a lot of space
- The truly damaging mounts have a very low rate of fire
- Can't be used to bombard planets

Fighters
Pros:
- Unlimited supply
- Virtually unlimited range
- Deep scouting
- Expendable targets for enemy missiles and fighters
Cons:
- Need to lose a complete squadron before a new one is generated
- Low speed
- "Fish school" flight AI

Missiles
Pros:
- Best damage / weight ratio (only pre-data patch!)
- Speed
Cons:
- Grouped targetting wastes a whole volley in overkill
- Limited supply

This quick comparison explains my preference for mixed designs. At the very
least, both my carriers and IF have at least one spinal-type beam weapon so
they aren't useless once their last volley has been fired or their fighter
complement is out fighting planetside while a SR TF approaches your ships.

To maximize the weaponry effect for fighters and missiles, when fighting ne=
ar
armed planets, I always select each TF and target the planet every 5 seconds
to make sure all my indirect weaponry is in flight and ready to react to
enemy TFs popping up midway. Usually, the first or second volley wipes out
planetary bases, leaving the rest available to re-acquire whatever target=
 lies
in-between.

The benefits of using lots of fighters in any fleet can't be stressed enoug=
h.=20
They provide deep recon by forcing enemy ships to uncloack when firing,=20
and plenty of distraction for fighters and especially missiles.
When a 1000-damage warhead blows up a 30-HP fighter, that's 970 damage gone=
 to
waste. Of course, this works both ways. Note that normally, though, with
decent cloaking and ECM on your TFs, the AI seems incapable of targetting=
 your
main fleets, giving the human player a distinct advantage. To maximize this,
use the launch method described above as soon as you have a target.

The data patch has changed missiles: half damage, but a much quicker rate of
fire. In practice, this means you'll apply much more damage in a shorter=20
timeframe. This also means your IF ships will end up as sitting ducks within
one and two minutes of combat, and if you still got serious opposition at=
 that
time, too bad: your fleet's efficiency is severely hampered.
Now more than ever, I am comforted in my mixed design approach.
Major difference is that I find I don't build any IF-type ships at all
anymore by now, just LR, PD, reco and carriers.


--------------( 3.E Missiles and Racks )-----------------------------------=
---
               ------------------------
When designing your missile complement, keep in mind that there are two wei=
ght
components: individual missile weight and rack weight. Adding several racks
ensures larger volleys being shot, adding more missiles per rack ensure that
more volleys can be shot. On large hulls, I tend to limit myself to 5 racks,
counting 5+ missiles per rack. But this is also due to my preference for mi=
xed
designs, as the rest of the space gets occupied by a bunch of fighters and a
couple of Spinal+ direct fire weapons.

Note that the heavy chassis sports the best damage / space ratio. Avoid usi=
ng
torpedoes.



--------------( 3.F Defense )----------------------------------------------=
---
               -------------
Armor doesn't take up space, but tends to cost a lot. Shields are relatively
cheap compared to armor, but take up quite a bit of space, have less stoppi=
ng
power, and tend to get depleted pretty quick.
Hence I usually boost industry DEAs on 5-10 size-12 planets and skip shields
altogether.

When in need for shielding, though (the enemy is close in techs or ahead of
me in techs), I go for damper fields as soon as they are available. Although
they are weaker in sheer power than Class VII+ shields, they recharge to fu=
ll
strength every 5 seconds, never running out, while traditional shields run
out after 1-2 blasts.


--------------( 3.G Electronics )------------------------------------------=
---
               -----------------
Due to the lack of explanations on the manual, some confusion exists about=
 the
respective effect of ECM and ECCM.
To summarize what those _should_ do:
- ECM jam enemy battle computers, rendering the detection of your TFs more
difficult
- ECCM unscrambles your own battle computers.
ECM and ECCM of the same level cancel each other out. However, contrary to
some people's assumption, this doesn't mean that having both in your TFs ma=
kes
them usueless. By design, they are matched against enemy devices, not your
own.=20

But where to place them?
Putting both devices on the same ship is a pure waste of space. ECM is a=20
defensive device, it is probably best placed on your PD ships. ECCM, on the
other hand, is a detection device, and it's best located on your recon ship=
s.

Note that ECM protects your whole TF to a point, while ECCM, like the scan
devices, work a tad differently.
In MOO3, whenever one single ship notices an enemy ship or weapon, your who=
le
fleet sees them at once.

In practice, the computer adds up all the values of each individual ECM in
your fleet and matches them against the total of the opposing ECCM. If your
ECM values (see the tech tables below) totals are higher, your fleet will be
protected. If it's lower, it won't - and vice versa.

Cloaking: I haven't had much time to delve into specifics so far, but from a
cursory look, it seems to have two effects: a visual cloaking value, and an
ECM value. There's a big difference, though: The weakest cloak's ECM value=
 is
as good as ECM V... for a much smaller space and a ludicrously low cost.
Which would mean that using any ECM device over cloaking is just a waste of
space and money as long as you're ahead in the tech race.
*sigh*. Yet another area where a better manual would have helped... I miss=
=20
SMAC / SMAX's detailed encyclopedia...

Note that contrary to ECM, ECCM and detection devices, cloaks can't be
stacked. Which means it's usually a good idea to have your PD ships adding
to your TF's total jamming value.


--------------( 3.H Speed )------------------------------------------------=
---
               -----------
As my tactics mainly involve sniping from afar or using missiles with=20
fighters, planet-side fights don't recquire a lot of speed.
That doesn't mean you should spare the space and drop your system drive spe=
ed
to 1 - when flying interception missions or fighting a guardian, your IF and
carriers are exposed, as they won't launch their weaponry before they spot a
target.
I tend to have my system drives at 60%-75% of max speed at any times. For=
 LRs,
which need a bit more mobility, I usually select 80% of max speed.
Note that your TFs will (obviously) always move at the speed of your slowest
ship within that TF, so keep that in mind when designing and assembling your
TFs.


--------------( 3.I Ship types and TFs )-----------------------------------=
---
               ------------------------
Apart from the obvious like colony and outpost ships, what to build?
As highlighted in the weapon comparison, carriers and IF ships pretty much=
 own
the battlefield, especially when building mixed designs or at least mixed=
 TFs.

In complement to carriers and IF ships, I build a set of mixed LRS as well,=
 to
add some punch to my TFs when combat becomes more close and personal.

I don't like SR ships nor SR TFs. They simply have to get too close to be
effective - which means lots of losses. Also, to be effective, you would
probably want to go for full speed and shields - at the expense of firepowe=
r.

I tend to have several hull sizes per ship type, so that all my planets can
contribute to the building effort.

For TFs, I build nothing but armadas for offense fleets. A carrier armada
sports the following combination:
- 1-2 cap-ship carriers (by turn 200+, titans or bigger)
- 4-5 smaller carriers (by turn 200+, BC to SDN)
- 1 cap IF
- 4 smaller IFs
- 1 big LRS (DN or better)

Escort ring:
- 2 PD ships (currently one LC and one BC)
- 2 BC+-sized LRS

Picket ring:
- 2 medium-sized reco

IF armadas are currently very similar, I usually only invert the carrier and
IF ship numbers. In practice, however, as I use mixed ship designs as well,=
 I
tend to limit myself to building IF TFs, unless I run out of IF cap ships.

Note that in combat, you are limited to 10 TFs per assault. The CPU selects
your best TFs present in the system to do the job.

This _seems_ to exclude system ships and orbitals, but I need to confirm th=
is
sometime soon.

One use I have for SR TFs is to build one brand of mid-sized SR ships,=20
and include sensor-heavy recon ships in the TFs. I group them in smaller
TFs and use them as detectors / decoys in heavily defended and cloacked are=
as,
typically guardians and Orion. Those throwaway TFs don't survive for long,=
 but
usually allow to detect the opponent and attract its fire without risking=
 the
lives of my main (and expensive) armadas.


--------------( 3.J Target Saturation )------------------------------------=
---
               ----------------------
To summarize some things which are scattered throughout this FAQ, let me
formally introduce the notion of target saturation.
In MOO3 terms, saturation means offering your opponent multiple distractions
aside from your main fleet.
The more advanced targets lie between your TFs and the opponent, the less=
 the
risk that a heavy missile volley reaches your ships. Saturation is a huge
boost to defense, and costly to overcome in offense.

Saturation is best achieved by massive fighter groups (hence again one
advantage to using mixed designs). When you reach Cruiser hull size, try to
have all your main ships carrying at least 5 interceptors - that's 60
additional targets to absorb one missile volley flying ahead of your ships.

Saturation also works well for missile volleys themselves: the more missiles
per volley, the more you'll get through the opponent's PD walls.

To counter saturation is much more difficult. In solo, that's no issue: the=
 AI
doesn't use it. But in multiplayer, this could become tricky very quick. The
keys to overcome fighter saturation would be lightning field and light-moun=
ted
PD weaponry.
I would venture that on large-scale battles involving two high-tech human
players, a winning fleet setup would involve the following:
- Cruiser+ PD ships, sporting 10+ Lighting Field Generators, Damper Fields,
a handful of long-range direct fire beams and scores of light-mounted PDs
- Reco ships, perhaps the same size, packed with electronics, LFG and Dampe=
rs
- Cap ships Titan+, at least 10 ion dual-pod fighters, LFG, good PD beams=
 and
some serious long-ranged beam bruising capabilities. Missile set-up is tric=
ky
here: It's perhaps better to have less racks with more missiles in order to
outlast enemy saturation. Just a hunch, though.

Now for the fleet buildup, assuming you're able to sport 10 armadas, Id' try
out 7 Carrier armadas patrolling in the farthest edge of the map, and 3 PD
armadas patrolling about 3 squares ahead of them. Make sure your 7 carriers
send out 4-5 missile volleys and their fighter complement at once. When an
enemy TF becomes visible, don't group-target more than two armadas at the
same time - wait about 3-5 seconds before targetting with 2 more TFs. When
the enemy missile stream starts to trickle down, carefully close in for the
kill, and let your beams and fighters do the job from afar.

Alternatively, I could suggest building one reco TF with Titan+ sized scout=
s:
ultra-heavy armor, full damper fields, full cloak, scanners and jammers, and
a bunch of short-ranged beams. Wait 'till the initial missile exchange=20
trickles down, then send this one forward a bit outside of the direct path=
=20
between your main TFs and where the opponent seemed to launch his stuff fro=
m.
Use this special TFs for both reconnaissance and decoy purposes.

Those are just ideas, BTW, none of them field-tested, as I don't multiplay.
As with all such games, it's just theorycraft - if you get wasted by a bett=
er
opponent, don't just curse me: learn from your opponent, and if you would,
send me an email telling me where the above theories fall severly short.
Remember this old military maxim: no plan survives enemy contact.

This section owes to an e-mail sent to me by Mark Reyhner, who noted that=
 for
fighters, Death Ray offered a better raw dmg / spc and Firedefay ratio than
the rest. After thinking about it, though, I'll favour Dual-podded Ion
fighters because of saturation, until armor piercing gets back in.

--------------( Hull Sizes )-----------------------------------------------=
---
                ----------
The data patch halves all hull base costs. Tables have been updated.
///Updated v0.82
Zhaneel reminded me that in the patch documentation, this halving supposedly
applies only to orbitals and system ships. This led me to re-browse the tech
tables.
This results in the following distinctions between the ship classes (numbers
are multipliers over base values):

Class          Cost   Capacity
------------------------------
Orbitals       0.66   1.5
System Ships   0.75   1.33
Starships      1      1

In short, you fit more stuff for less money on orbitals and system ships,=
 PLUS
you spare the space for warp drives. This gives defenders a big theoretical
advantage, offset by the fact that, when defending a planet, you can't laun=
ch
your mobile weaponry before an enemy taskforce uncloaks.
Possible strategy in multiplayer: don't build planetary defense bases at al=
l -
you'll deprive an opponent of an initial target, which negates his saturati=
on
advantage and forces him to close in and expose himself.
When you have both orbitals and system ships, move your system TFs away=20
sideways from the planet towards the farther edge of the map (where your
opponents TF's are hiding), so that he only spots your orbitals, then
move in sideways, lauch your mobile weaponry and aim for the kill.
In such a strategy, as orbitals are sitting ducks anyway, give them scores
of the longest-range DFs on ultra spinal mounts, and use the extra space to
add at least standard damper fields. That should be enough to field a serio=
us
defense.

Finally, regarding orbitals, you can have 4 orbitals around your planet, and
three more per moon. Ethereans with their preference for huge gas giants wh=
ich
are surrounded by lots of moons have a distinct racial advantage for defense
over all other races here.

Behemoth          6853    3265
Leviathan        11122    4615

Notes:
The advantage of bigger sizes are of course their sheer payload. On the oth=
er
hand, though, their cost can become quite a burden on your PP. Keep track of
your production capacities: A behemoth-sized ship requires you have at least
a couple of worlds capable of churning out 7000+ PPs per turn in order to=
 get
built at a reasonable pace.

Notes:

 UHA
will be much cheaper (hence faster to build), at the expense of about 25%-4=
0% in
deflection value. But it might be worth considering.

Example: Duranium UHA: cost 1080, Armor 3200, Defl 12
         Titanium VHA: cost 1680, Armor 3200, Defl 17.5


--------------( Shields )--------------------------------------------------=
---
                -------

Shield Generators come in three variants: small, standard, and large.

Each size provides 1.5x regen rates and shield str over the smaller size,
but cost and space doubles every time. If you need the space, absolutely
prefer better armor and smaller generator.

There are 10 shield types plus Damper fields available. For an increase
in cost, each size gives you better defletion values and recharge rates, at
the same space cost - therefore only cost is a consideration when deciding=
 on
the type you need.

Notes:
Traditional shield purchasing gets completely outclassed if you manage to=20
research Damper fields. Damper fields cost quite a bit more than normal=20
shields, and take thrice the space, but they regenerate their whole strength
every 5 seconds. Although technically, the shield resistance for class VII+=
 is=20
better, it gets chipped away with every shot, usually way faster than its=20
recharge rate. Meanwhile, your damper fields keep recharging until the end=
 of
the battle.

(1) PD has MultFire value of 2. Which means a PD should shoot twice as much

Note that Ultra Heavy Mounts are better than Spinals and Improved Spinals,=
=20
at the expense of space and cost. The lower Fire Delay is also worth=20
considering.
In practice, you can fit twice as much Improved Spinals than Ultra Heavies,
but they will fire less than half often. If cost is a factor (because your
production capabilities are an issue), though, prefer Ultra Heavy Mounts.

kills your target, the rest gets wasted.

Analysis per weapon type:
-------------------------
Beams:
Beams wield the longest range overall. However, this comes at a cost:
Both damage and accuracy are severly lowered at the longer ranges.
They also sport a good Damage / space ratio. They are very well-suited for=
 PD
to standard mounts on short distances. If you plan to snipe from afar, thou=
gh,
avoid beams.
Adding to their PD suitability is the fact that Ion Pulse and Phasers sport
the AutoFire improvement.
Note that the stellar converter, with a Fire Delay of 8 and a huge space co=
st
is simply not worth the trouble for a combat weapon. It's only use: convert=
ing
planets to ashes, period.

Mass Drivers:
Mass drivers have one huge thing going for them: damage remains constant ov=
er
distance. Their accuracy, however, is only 50%. This makes them a risky bet
to use as PD weapons, IMO.
///New v0.82
Also, due to the fact that most damage dropoff happens near MaxRange, their
advantage isn't really that great anyway.
///
In the early turns, never use mass drivers over lasers - they're just worse
all over the band.
For PDs, a decent late-game alternative to Phasers would be the Disruptor=20
cannon, though. It's range / damage ratio is almost 4 times better than=20
phasors for a slight cost increase, and it holds the AF improvement as well.
Also consider that you need 44 Phasors to match the damage of 10 disruptors=
 -
making them longer to design. With the extra range, the disruptor has plenty
of time to shoot a second time if the first shot misses. A good investment=
 for
cap ships.

Particle:
Particle weapons are quite similar to beams in general. However, their=20
Dmg / space ratio is none too impressive, the loss of damage on max distance
is bad.
Initially, the Death Ray would seem like a decent pick due to its short Fire
Delay. However, the absence of any improvements leaves is sorely outclassed.
Altogether, particles are just not worth the trouble. If you could steer yo=
ur
research, I would never bother in the first place...

Plasma:
Plasma weapons offer the shortest max range, but pack an excellent Damage=
 /
space ratio. They are altogether a tad lighter than their counterparts in
other DF weapon types.
Of all the plasma weapons available, the Megabolt Cannon is the best choice,
provided you manage to research or steal all three improvements available.
With a Fire Delay of 4, and a disappointing damage spread, the Mauler,
however, is just a waste of space.

Analysis:
With this consolidated chart, things become quite obvious, now, don't they?
In particuliar, properly factoring in improvements demonstrates clearly what
I introduced a couple of versions ago: Disruptor Cannons own the late-game,
especially as PD weapons.

At 3rd place, the Gauss Cannon ought to be your mid / late game pick if you=
're
building short-range ships and TFs.

For Late-Game LR ships / TFs, the Dark Matter Projector is an excellent
solution despite the accuracy penalty - consider however the Megabolt cannon
as an add-on to improve MaxRange accuracy.
There's still the special case of the Ion Pulse Cannon: If ArmorPiercing ge=
ts
patched back in, expect its rating to drop several ranks. Use with caution.
For early-game PD, use Hard Beams or Hellfire Cannons, then switch to Phase=
rs=20
until you get the Disruptor Cannons and their improvements.

As hinted earlier, skip Mass Drivers altogether, and do whatever it takes to
research Quark Cannon before you get involved in early-game fights - you'll
dominate any enemy ships equipped with the first handfull of techs.
///

--------------( Bottomline )-----------------------------------------------=
---
                ----------
///Revised v0.82
Altogether, consider DF weapons to be first support and defense weaponry.
Sure, on short ranges, they are well worth the trouble, but short range com=
es
with higher casualties OR requires additional shielding (which removes space
for more firepower).
If you applied the first data patch, though, with the missile nerfs, you'll
find equipping all your ships with 1-2 Ultra Heavy or Ultra Spinal mounted
weapons in exchange of 1 missile less per rack a more than worthy tradeoff.
///
For a serious bruising effect, Ultra Spinal Mounts transform the weakest DF=
=20
into a serious threat - but the FireDly gets huge as well.
However, consider this: If your first shot is a guaranteed kill, you don't
need to worry about FireDly for the second one. Plus, on the range bonus
granted, 5 seconds more just means an already severly diminished TF closes
in a tiny bit, exposing itself to heavier damage on the second shot.

From those tables, the best fighter to use is the Phasors Fighter with Dual
Pods. It has the best Dmg/Space ratio and the best Dmg/cost ratio. It is,
comparatively, dirt cheap and small.
Even though sheer firepower is rather small and Fragility is very low, you=
 can
safely swarm out any opposing force with dozens of fighters, which means an
equivalent amount of targets to shoot down.

Important note: AP doesn't have any effect right now. This also means that
until ArmorPiercing gets patched in, the best fighter could actually be the
Ion Pulse cannon: they have thrice the HP of phaser fighters, and both lowe=
r=20
cost and space.

After applying the data patch, note that damage and cost for missiles have
been halved, while space has been _slightly_ lowered. At the same time,
the Fire Delay has been reduced a lot.

--------------( Warhead Chassis )------------------------------------------=

                ---------------

Notes:
A quick scan of the Dmg / Spc calculation shows that you'll get the most
out of Heavy Missile Chassis. In that respect, the Torpedo Chassis is a
complete waste of space and money. Yes, sheer power matters, but it doesn't
matter that much. The difference in space can be used either for another ra=

Those are the base values for each warhead types. Tags are self-explanatory.
Note that obviously, missiles don't suffer damage drop-off due to distance.
All missiles have an accuracy of 0.95 (omitted), a FireDelay of 45 (omitted=
),
and a target range (I read that as lock-on distance) of 40000 distance unit.
Current assumption set one square at roughly 4000 units, that  means a miss=
ile
in-flight will lock on any target within 10 squares of their current positi=
on.

Notes:
Well, it seems like things are pretty clearcut for missiles.
The better the warhead tech, the better the dmg / spc ratio, without much
ado. When it comes to missiles, just get the best you can get, mount it on a
heavy missile chassis, and you know it's just going to be a major bruiser.

In terms of missiles per rack, remember the rules laid out in section 3 abo=
ve:
Missiles use some space, and racks use some more space.
For your assault missiles, try to find the best balance between lasting pow=
er,
sheer damage and saturation (see section 3.J on that matter).

Regarding improvements, note that until Armor Piercing is patched in, don't
tick that box.
One final note: I haven't got a real clue about Warhead HP so far. Need to
delve into that topic anytime soon...

volley?"

My reply:
That's actually a tricky question, for two reasons:
1. I don't have any hard data for missile HP values (neither for hulls, BTW=
,=20
but that's beside this point). So it's kinda hard to know if it's harder to=
=20
blow up a high-tech warhead or not.
2. Target saturation theory would recommend the double amount of missiles
based on the raw data.

But look at the table again, in particuliar in respect to raw damage,=20
respectively damage / space. One anionic energy warhead takes up 6 space,=20
compared to 12 for the energy pulsar. Thing is, two anionics bring a damage=
=20
potential of 164, vs 1231 for the energy pulsar.
In other terms, you need 7.6x the space for equal damage - and that's just=
=20
considering warhead space - you need also to add 8 more racks which also=20
consume some space.

Now, against a fighter, you'll clearly prefer the quantity, because most of=
=20
the damage gets wasted whenever an energy pulsar blows up a fighter. But=20
against a cap ship? Since space is limited anyway, you'll have, in practice,
20 anionics in a volley vs. 10 energy pulsars. Now let's assume that missile
hp is constant no matter the tech level, and that the enemy PD shoots down=
=20
consistently 9 incoming missiles: the 11 anionics going through will apply=
=20
902 damage, still 300 points less than the single energy pulsar.

The cut-off point where you need to worry is when enemy PD manages to shoot=
=20
down 10 missiles, because obviously, your high-power volley just got wasted=
...

Thing is, though, that the AI _never_ shoots volleys in numbers you could=20
achieve with fully mixed design ships in at least two TFs - which also mean=
s=20
that aside perhaps orions, nobody's gonna be able to stop volleys of 60some=
=20
per TF. So in solo, I'd recommend going for the high damage any day.

In multiplayer, it can become trickier depending on your opponent. If both=
=20
human players practice saturation tactics, I'd say at max techs, building=20
around High-Energy X-Ray or Scatter Packs is probably gonna yield=20
the best results.

As in 3.J, the last paragraph here remains largely theorycraft, as I don't
multiplay. By all means, send me feedback on my assumptions!

To evaluate jamming and sensors is a tricky business, as the formulas invol=
ved
in MOO3's calculations are probably anything but obvious stuff.

I've been fiddling with my spreadsheets for hours and still lack any clue
about a comprehensive formula about how Jamming / cloaking offsets detectio=
n.

My main issue is to try to calculate the effective detection range versus
jamming / cloaking, in other words, the distance beyond which a cloaked ship
will remain invisible for each device used.

In practice, detection devices use a value called OffTgtRg (Offense Target
Range?), which seems matched against DefTgtRg (Defense Target Range?) used
by cloaking devices.=20

Anyway, without more sterile ravings, here is the raw data. If someone can
find out exactly how MOO3 calculates Invisibility range vs. Detection range,
drop me an e-mail. I'm curious.

TommyLV posted this on Gamefaqs:
For electronics here are my conclusions, they are reasonable but I make no=
=20
guarantee for their accuracy:
The values given for ECM's, ECCM's, Cloaks and Sensors are multipliers that
are made to the actual range to produce an apparent range. If the apparent=
=20
range is less than a certain value, the threshold detection value, then=20
detection occurs, if greater than the TDV then the target is still hidden.
All the ECM's in a TF are counted.
All the ECCM's in a TF are counted.
Only the best Sensor in the TF is counted. (Al: I'm sceptical here...)
Only the WORST Cloak in the TF is counted.
Every ship needs a Cloak in order not to give away the TF. This fact may=20
explain the enemies penchant for attacking Transports and Colony TFs, no on=
e=20
gives these ships Cloaks and they are easily detected.
As for the worst Cloak being relevant, the easiest ship to see would be the=
=20
one that would give away the TF.=20

A quick glance on this table confirms that cloaking is both cheaper and more
effective than jamming (ECM devices). However, cloaks can't be stacked.
Also, cloaks have a Cloaking value. How this one is used is anyone's guess.

Possibly, DefTgRg works for missile acquisition and is offset by ECCM, while
Cloaking works for visual detection, and is only offset by sensors. If that=
 is
the case, this would mean that missiles might be able to target a fleet,
while it remains untargettable by the main fleet? I wish I could do some
serious multiplayer testing for that, but that almost requires a second MOO3
CD - and this game is not THAT good.

Post data patch, most values have been changed, apparently without much rhy=
me
nor reason.
In short, ECCM and sensors _seem_ to have become more powerful than ECM aga=
in.

Without cloaking, detection has been made easier. In practice, I am under=
 the
impression my latest tests find guardians much quicker than before. That mi=
ght
be just me, though.
